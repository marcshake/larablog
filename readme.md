# Small Blogsoftware in Laravel

**This software is not intended to be used in a live environment. This repository is public, because I am working at this project LIVE and it is going to be improved on a daily basis. DO NOT USE THIS ON A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!!!**

## What is this?
Hi, my name is Marcel Schindler and I have been a webdeveloper for a long time. I usually worked on Webservices and never had the opportunity nor the necessarity of working with a full-featured-framework. I have a blog running at http://www.trancefish.de which is coded with my own little "Framework" which you can see over here: https://github.com/marcshake/tlog

Now I started to use Laravel in my workplace, because I heard so many good things about that framework. And it's so great. I love laravel so much, because it is just as complex as you want it to be. These sources here a *work in progress* because I am just creating a complete blog-software while writing a tutorial, which you can see soon on my website.

Whenever this program is *stable*, this text will be modified. Just take this tiny codes to see, how easy it is to actually *start* your own Laravel-production.

## Licence
Nope. Not now. The usual licenses of the dependencies apply but these codes are totally not worth a licence at the moment.
